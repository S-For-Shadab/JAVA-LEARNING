JAVA is one of a coffee breed  ,first OAK name was decided but it was already taken

"JAVA IS EVERYWHERE THIS IS THE SLOGAN ,Since it is platform independent
platform is nothing but the enviroment jisme software run ho pata ,eg in our computer operating system ek platform hai java can be run in different OS

PRINCIPLE OF JAVA:"Write Once , Run Anywhere(WORA)"

JAVA LIBRARY is a collection of predefined classes :we can use classes either by inheriting them or by insantiating them .
It is more secure since we dont have of pointer concept therefore we cant change memory location   data


We cant call java 100% oop language becoz sometimes lets say we are using loop we 'll do all our work using primitive datatype and we are not using any object 
To overcome this we are using WRAPPING CLASSES like to instead of using int datatpe we are using Integer class inbuild class that is and use its static function
eg:-Integer i=Integer.valueOf("123");//////valueOf function Integer class ka object banayega aur uska reference i ko dega 


here i is a reference variable storing  value 123 hence we are using OOPS here

We can use int i=Integer.parseInt("123"); also it used to converting string argument into integer and returns int value that can be stored in int datatype

to give i value to primitive datatype and use it, use intValue() function


Integer i=Integer.valueOf("123");
int c=i.intValue();
c=123 now


#####3valueOf,parseInt is  static method of wrapping class,intValue is an instance if wrapping class i.e Integer,Double,Charater,Long etc######

///////////Command line argument  Importance

public class SongName{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		
int s=0;
for(int i=0;i<args.length;i++)
s=s+Integer.parseInt(args[i]);////we can pass argument in args while running in command prompt writing java SongName 122 34 667 ;like this

System.out.println(s);
	
	
	}
}


##STRING BUILDER :-it is like string onlu but it will not make new element in heap memory when we concatenate and hence saves time


StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder("Tony");
sysout(sb);   ///Tony

sb.charAt(0)  ///T

We can also set characters in stringbuilder

sb.setCharAt(0,'P');
sysout(sb);///Pony



we can also insert character

sb.insert(0,'S');
sysout(sb);   ////SPony


we can also delete substring in string

sb.delete(2,3);
sysout(sb);  ///SPny


we can append element in string builder

sb.append("l");
sysout(sb);  ////SPnyl
